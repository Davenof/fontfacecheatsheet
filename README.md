                    This cheat sheet was compiled to be a quick and an easy-to-use reference tool. Although I have vetted the content
                    of this work for correctness, as well as validated the codes with the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C markup validation</a> 
                    and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">CSS validation</a> services, I cannot claim 100 percent accuracy
                    of the subject matter and the work. Hence, I have provided references to the resources I consulted while compiling this cheat sheet.

                    Nonetheless, this cheat sheet and all my works are open to correction and suggestions for improvement, as well as to help
                    those who may find any of my works useful.
